"""
Python port of
https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12416581/THRIFT-563.patch with
the following additions
Implement a new process_queued interface to be used with our non blocking
thrift server implementation. For other thrift servers the process
implementation remains unmodified.
The following modifications are made:
    The parsing logic is factored out into an internal method to be used by
    process and process_queued.
    Create a threadpool per service and queue requests per service if
    requested, defaults to no workers.
    Allow for capping of queue length to prevent DDOS
    Leave the process interface as is for compatability with other thrift
    servers.
