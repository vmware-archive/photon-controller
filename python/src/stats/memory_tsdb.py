""" memory_tsdb.py

    Simple in-memory time-series database.
    It provides a simple interface

    add(<key string>, <timestamp>, <data>)

    to add a new value to the time series database. Timestamp is in seconds
    since the epoch (i.e the return value of time()). The key string has to
    be unique for this instance and serves as a unique identifier for a
    time series across the distributed system. Data can be any serializable
    structure.

    Retention: The memory DB retains values in the database according to the
    set retention policy. However values are not pruned by time but rather by
    their number. The DB calculates a max number of samples from the retention
    policy and retains that amount in the database. As a consequence if a stats
    producer diverts from the frequency set by the policy then the DB may
    contain a larger set of samples than the retention policy specified.
