 * <p>
 * Note: see PRECONDITION_STATES for formalization of the above diagram
 * <p>
 * - CREATING - the DB entities have been created, the VM has an ID. The backend request to create the VM was
 * sent. Will transition to  STOPPED when successfully created. If unsuccessful the only valid state transition
 * will be DELETED.
 * <p>
 * - DELETED - the VM is at end of life, all infrastructure resources are released, the VM can not be started,
 * it is essentially a zombie with only it's DB entities and skeleton state remaining. DELETED VMs are automatically
 * garbage collected. Transition to DELETED occurs on a Delete Vm API call (VM must be in STOPPED state).
 * <p>
 * - STOPPED - on a successful create, the VM enters the STOPPED state. A VM in the STARTED state may transition
 * to STOPPED through an explicit call to the StopVm API
 * <p>
 * - STARTED - a STOPPED VM enters the STARTED state on an explicit call to the StartVm API. A SUSPENDED VM enters
 * this state on an explicit call to the ResumeVm API.
 * <p>
 * - SUSPENDED - VM in the STARTED state may enter the SUSPENDED state during an explicit call to the SuspendVm API
 * <p>
 * - ERROR - VM creation has failed
