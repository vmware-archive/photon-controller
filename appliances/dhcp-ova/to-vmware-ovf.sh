 \
8.	    INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INDEMNIFICATION. \
 \
8.1	Defense and Indemnification.

The foregoing obligations are applicable only if You:  (i) promptly notify VMware in writing of the Infringement Claim; (ii) allow VMware sole control over the defense for the claim and any settlement negotiations; and (iii) reasonably cooperate in response to VMware requests for assistance.  You may not settle or compromise any Infringement Claim without the prior written consent of VMware. \
