"""
    This is a base class for the execution of a
    non-recurring background task. The task is
    executed in a newly created thread (called
    the runner-thread in the following) of class
    TaskRunnerThread.

    Users of this class are expected to sub class it
    and implement the execute_task() method which should
    contain the code task execution code. The
    execution of the task is limited in time and
    can be stopped by calling the method stop().
    The code that executes the task is responsible
    for periodically checking if the task should
    terminate before its natural end; either because
    the task has exhausted its allocated time or
    because it was stopped.

    This is achieved by requesting the task to call
    the method is_stopped() at regular intervals.
    This approach has been chosen (rather than killing
    the thread) to give the task code the choice of where
    to interrupt execution (presumably when its state is
    clean: no open files, no pending communication ..).
    The state of finished task can be queried by
    calling the method get_exception(). If None is
    returned the execution finished successfully.
    Otherwise the terminating exception will be
    returned.

    The state of the task runner is controlled by two
    variables: "active" and "running".

    The variable "active" is inited to False when
    the object is created. The transition from
    False to True is achieved by calling the start()
    method on the object. This transition cannot be
    performed by the runner-thread. The transition
    from True to False can occur when the stop()
    method is called (again not by the runner thread)
    or at the end of task execution within the
    runner-thread.

    The value of "running" can only be changed by
    the runner-thread. It is set to False when the object
    is created. It is turned to True when the task
    starts running (following a call to start()).
    It is set back to False when the task has finished
    running.

    The two variables can be both set to False when
    nothing is running; or both set to True when the task
    is executing. The combination False, True denotes the
    state in which the stop() method has been called
    but the task is still executing. The combination True,
    False is allowed during the short time between the
    creation of the runner-thread and when it actually
    starts executing.
